# Loan Risk Prediction System
> Smarter Lending Decisions: ML-powered Loan Risk Prediction

In today's dynamic financial landscape, accurately assessing creditworthiness is key to mitigating risk for lending institutions. With the power of machine learning, one can venture into the realm of loan prediction, offering cutting-edge solutions for smarter, more sustainable lending practices.

The ability to predict whether a loan applicant will default or repay their loan is vital for lending institutions. Leveraging advancements in technology and the abundance of data, machine learning models have emerged as robust tools, surpassing traditional statistical approaches in accuracy and efficiency.

An organization aims to predict potential loan defaulters for their consumer loan product. With historical customer behavior data at their disposal, they seek to identify riskier applicants when acquiring new customers, ensuring sound lending decisions.

After preprocessing and splitting the data into training and testing sets, the journey unfolds. Three distinct ML classification models take center stage. Each model is meticulously fitted with the training data, and their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score—the crucial metrics for classification problems—are evaluated. Finally, a champion model is selected to make predictions about whether a loan applicant will default or repay.

The project isn't just about predictions; it's an expedition into revolutionizing the lending landscape. The outcome empowers organizations to make informed and strategic decisions, ultimately maximizing profitability and ensuring sustainable lending practices.
